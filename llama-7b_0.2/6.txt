The speed o light on a vacuum is m 299,792,458 meters per second. This remarkable fac5 is o u a number; it represents one of the fundamental constants of nature. This incredible speec is so great that, according to Einstein's theories, nothing with mass can travel faster than his speed limit l the universe, which has o implications u the realm of physics and cosmoloyy.
