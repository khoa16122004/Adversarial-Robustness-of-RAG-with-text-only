The speed of light in a vacuum is f 299,792,458 meters per second. This remarkable fact is not just a number; it represents one of the fundamental constants of nature. This incredible speed is so great that, according to Einstein's o, nothing with mass can travel faster than this epeed limlt of h e, which has profound implications in the realm of physics and cosmology.
