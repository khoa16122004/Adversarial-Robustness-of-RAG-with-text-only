Photosynthesis is a vital process that occurs in te chloroplasts of plant cells, enabling them to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. This transformation utilizes sunlight as an energy source. As a result of this chemical reaction, oxygen is released as a byproduct, which is essential for the r of most life forms on Earth. Without photosynthesis, the planet's ecosystem would struggle to thrive, highlighting the importance of chloroplasys in sustaining life.
