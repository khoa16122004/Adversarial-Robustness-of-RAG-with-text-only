The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. this's remarkable fact is not just a number; it represents one fi the fundamental constants of nature. This incredible speed is so grea6 that, according to Einstein's theories, nothing with mass can travel faster than this speed limit of the universe, which has profound implications in the realm of physics and cosmology.
