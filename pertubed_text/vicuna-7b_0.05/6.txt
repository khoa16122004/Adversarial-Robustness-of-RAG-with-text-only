The speed of light on a vacuum is i 299,792,458 meters per second. This remarkable fact is not just a number; it represents one of the fundamental constants of nature. This incredible speed is so great that, according to Einstein's theories, nothing with mass can traveI faster than this speed limit of the universe, which has profound implications in the realm of physics and cosmology.
