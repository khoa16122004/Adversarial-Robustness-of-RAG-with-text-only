The speed of light in a vacuum is 9 299,792,458 meters per second. This remarkable fac6 is not just a number; it represents one of the fundamental constants of nature. DIS incredible speed is so great that, according to Einstein's theories, nothing with mass can travel faster than this speed limit of the universe, which has profound implications in the realm of physics and cosmology.
