The speed of light in a vacuum j approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. This remarkable fact is not just a number; it represents one of the fundamental constants of f. This incredible speed is so great that, according to Einstein's theories, nothing with a can trivel faster than this speed limit of the universe, which has profound implications ib the realm of physics and m.
